# SNAKE-WATER-GUN-GAME---METHOD-2
PYTHON PROJECT - METHOD - 2
1.	PROJECT EXPLANATION
The project is a Python program that simulates the classic childhood game "Snake, Water, Gun." It allows users to play against the computer by choosing one of three options: snake, water, or gun. The program then determines the winner based on the rules of the game.
2.	CHALLENGES
Some potential challenges in developing this project might include implementing the game logic accurately, handling user input validation, and ensuring a smooth user experience.
3.	CHALLENGES OVERCOMED
To address these challenges, the developer likely needed to carefully design the game logic to accurately reflect the rules of "Snake, Water, Gun." They might have implemented input validation to ensure that users can only choose valid options (s, w, or g). Additionally, they might have added error handling to handle unexpected inputs from the user.
4.	AIM 
The aim of the project is to provide an enjoyable gaming experience for users by recreating the classic "Snake, Water, Gun" game in a Python program.
5.	PURPOSE
